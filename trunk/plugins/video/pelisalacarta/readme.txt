XBMC Media Center (formerly named "XBox Media Center") is a free and open source 
cross-platform media-player and entertainment hub. It was originally created for 
the first-generation Xbox game-console, but is now available for the Linux, 
Mac OS X (Leopard, Tiger, Apple TV), and Microsoft Windows operating systems. 

There is also a bootable Live CD version referred to as "XBMC Live"

XBMC supports most common audio, video, and image formats, playlists, audio 
visalizations, slideshows, weather reporting, and third-party plugins. 

It is network-capable (internet and LAN shares).

Through its plugin system which is based on Python, XBMC is expandable via 
add-ons that include features such as television program guides, YouTube, 
Hulu, Veoh, online movie trailer support, and SHOUTcast/Podcast streaming.

XBMC as a whole is distributed under the GNU General Public License 
(with a few libraries used by XBMC licensed under the LGPL). XBMC is not 
produced, endorsed, or supported by Microsoft, which means that XBMC 
for Xbox requires a modchip or softmod exploit, or reflashing the Xbox onboard 
BIOS EEPROM chip with a modified BIOS.

-- Why i do this?                    --
---------------------------------------

I do it because I like it. 

I don't know if a lot of users will use it, but even if I am the only user i still do the work.

And I publish it because this never would be possible without XBMC, an incredible project totally open and free. 

This way i return a fraction of what I received.
