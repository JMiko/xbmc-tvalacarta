-- What is XBMC?                       --
-----------------------------------------

XBMC Media Center (formerly named "XBox Media Center") is a free and open source 
cross-platform media-player and entertainment hub. It was originally created for 
the first-generation Xbox game-console, but is now available for the Linux, 
Mac OS X (Leopard, Tiger, Apple TV), and Microsoft Windows operating systems. 

There is also a bootable Live CD version referred to as "XBMC Live"

XBMC supports most common audio, video, and image formats, playlists, audio 
visalizations, slideshows, weather reporting, and third-party plugins. 

It is network-capable (internet and LAN shares).

Through its plugin system which is based on Python, XBMC is expandable via 
add-ons that include features such as television program guides, YouTube, 
Hulu, Veoh, online movie trailer support, and SHOUTcast/Podcast streaming.

XBMC as a whole is distributed under the GNU General Public License 
(with a few libraries used by XBMC licensed under the LGPL). XBMC is not 
produced, endorsed, or supported by Microsoft, which means that XBMC 
for Xbox requires a modchip or softmod exploit, or reflashing the Xbox onboard 
BIOS EEPROM chip with a modified BIOS.

-- What is this plugin for?            --
-----------------------------------------

XBMC plugin for tvalacarta is a derivative work of XOT-UZG (http://code.google.com/p/xot-uzg/), a plugin that allows to extract videos from a website and view them inside XBMC. 

Its authors have included connectors for various websites, but have developed the plugin 
so that anyone can easily add new websites.

So that is exactly what I did. 

I added some Spanish TV sites with video on demand, and I keep 
working on it adding more sites.

Currently works with:

    * ADNStream
    * RTVA - Andalucía
    * Antena 3
    * Barcelona TV
    * Canal Plus TV
    * EITB - País Vasco
    * Extremadura TV
    * TVE
    * Mediateca TVE
    * TVG - Galicia
    * Mallorca TV
    * TV3 - Catalunya
    * Turbonick
    * RTVV - Valencia
    * Terra.tv

-- Installation                        --
-----------------------------------------

tvalacarta can operate as a plugin or script, two different operating modes in XBMC.

For now I recommend operation mode "script," which is what I use, so in order to 
install the file to decompress the ZIP file in the "scripts" directory of your XBMC.

Windows full path "C:\Program Files\XBMC\scripts".

XBOX, Linux and Mac ... (coming soon).

-- Why i do this?                    --
---------------------------------------

I do it because I like it. 

I don't know if a lot of users will use it, but even if I am the only user i still do the work.

And I publish it because this never would be possible without XBMC, an incredible project totally open, free. 

This way i return a fraction of what I received.
